# Final_Cleaned_Sales_Analysis

## 📄 Project Overview
This project focuses on **cleaning, enriching, analyzing, and visualizing** sales data from multiple Excel sheets.  
The final output is a fully polished dataset and a set of meaningful sales insights for reporting.

## 🛠 Project Steps Completed
- ✔️ Loaded messy Excel data with incorrect headers and unwanted rows
- ✔️ Cleaned and corrected column names
- ✔️ Fixed 'Order Date' column format
- ✔️ Split 'Product' field into 'Car Model' and 'Car Make'
- ✔️ Removed rows with missing critical data
- ✔️ Merged:
  - Region Master (Region Name + Country)
  - Product Master (Category)
- ✔️ Recalculated 'Inconsistent_Flag' for missing/incomplete records
- ✔️ Handled duplicates (keeping latest based on Order Date)
- ✔️ Created important visualizations:
  - Country-wise Sales Bar Chart
  - Quarterly Sales Trends (Top 10 Car Makes) Line Chart
  - Product Contribution Donut Chart
- ✔️ Saved cleaned dataset and charts
